# Madou Monogatari 3 (PC-98) (June 2024) #

## Intro ##
‚ÄúAHHHHHHH!!! She's not listening at all! I've gotta run away for now!‚Äù

Arle and Carbuncle set off to prepare for the Magic Academy when they're accosted by a beautiful, haughty woman accusing Arle of bewitching the man she loves, Lord Satan. Immune to reason, the woman and her companion Minotarous chase Arle until she finds herself deep in the Illusion Forest, where no one returns alive. What will become of her this time?

The patch has been tested on a PC-9821 AP2.
If your system can run the Japanese version of the game, then this version
should work as well. If you run into any issues, please let us know!

For emulating, we recommend Neko Project with save state support enabled.
You can save anywhere in the base game, but you have to insert a data floppy
to save, then reinsert the game floppy every time. Save stating instead
makes things a bit easier. We do recommend saving manually now and then
just in case! If we release an updated patch, you'll need to make a manual
save before switching over.

## Tips ##
- The game does NOT use numbers for health and damage! Instead, values are
  described via words, such as "I'm still doing great!" or
  "Oh god my vision's fading..."
- Always buy the Skillful Algae, Swift Algae, and Eyeball Grass from the merchants!
  They have a limited supply and permanently increase your stats.
- Some enemies are weak to Fire, whereas others are weaker to Ice Storm.
  For instance, Puyos will freeze when hit by Ice Storm, then break when hit by
  Ice Storm again. Try different combinations and see what sticks!
- In this one, you start with all the spells you need. Being level 1, however,
  means you may not have the mana required for a while.
